# FinEdge-Like-Website

The website is developed using the Astro framework along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Astro Starter Kit: Basics

npm create astro@latest -- --template basics

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ images/
|   |   â””â”€â”€ logo.png
|   |   â””â”€â”€ img1.png
|   |   â””â”€â”€ img2.png
|   |   â””â”€â”€ img3.png
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Header.astro
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Footer.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
â”‚   |   â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â”‚   |   â””â”€â”€ aboutUs.astro
â”‚   |   â””â”€â”€ services.astro
â”‚   |   â””â”€â”€ contactUs.astro
|   â””â”€â”€ styles/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ style.css
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ bg1.jpg
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.
