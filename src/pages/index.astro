                        <p>In the end, setting smart investing goals is what plays the biggest role in determining our investing success. unfortunately, most of us end up chasing short term returns during our investment planning journeys, leading to a poor experience. Instead, basing your investment plan on the foundation of investing goals can help you control and manage detrimental investing behaviours like greed and fear, thereby keeping you focused on the big picture instead of worrying about short term fluctuations or trends. </p>
                        <p>Goal based investing also helps you maintain a balanced approach towards your cash flows and savings, thereby ensuring that your key financial health ratios are in check. A goal plan acts as a roadmap towards a better financial future, ensuring reduced financial stress and a greatly enhanced investing journey.</p>
